# SAL-CryptoPulse

The official implementation of the paper "CryptoPulse: Short-Term Cryptocurrency Forecasting with Dual-Prediction and Cross-Correlated Market Indicators". Portions of the code have been adapted from the DLinear implementation.

## üöÄ Features


- **Short-Term Forecasting**: Predict cryptocurrency prices with a model designed for short-term predictions(next-day).
- **Batch Processing**: Run predictions for multiple cryptocurrencies at once.
- **Flexible & Easy to Use**: Install, run, and watch the results roll in!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

You can install the package directly from GitHub with `pip`:

        pip install git+https://github.com/aamitssharma07/SAL-Cryptopulse.git

Alternatively, you can install it manually:

1. Clone the repo:

        git clone https://github.com/aamitssharma07/SAL-Cryptopulse.git

        cd SAL-Cryptopulse

2. Install dependencies in a virtual environment:

        python -m venv env_crypto

        env_crypto\Scripts\activate

        pip install -e .

## üéØ Usage

After installation, you can run the model directly using the package's command line interface if you had installed the package directly from GitHub with `pip :

    For a single run:
    
        cryptopulse --data <crypto-ticker-symbol> --train-epochs 10 --batch-size 32 

    For batch processing (multiple cryptos at once):
    
        cryptopulse_batch

Alternatively, you can run the model using the Python command if you have cloned the repo in your local

    For a single run:
    
        python -m cryptopulse.main --data BTC-USD --train-epochs 10 --batch-size 32

    For batch processing (multiple cryptos at once):
    
        python -m cryptopulse.batch_processor

## üìä Results

All results are saved in the results/cryptopulse_results directory.
